What is the UV index?
The UVI is a measure of the level of UV radiation.

The values of the index vary throughout the day and range from zero upward - the higher the UVI, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur.

The UVI gives an indication of the level of UV radiation and the potential danger of sun exposure. It can help individuals make healthy choices.
